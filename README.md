# Car Insurance Claim Classification Project Overview

This project notebook, ["Car Insurance Claim.ipynb"](https://github.com/afifamir/insurance_claim_classification/blob/main/Car%20Insurance%20Claim.ipynb), presents a comprehensive analysis and classification task related to car insurance claims. The key steps and processes covered in the notebook include:

## 1. Data Understanding and Exploration

- **Dataset Overview:** 
  - The notebook begins by loading and examining the dataset, likely related to car insurance claims.

- **Data Exploration:**
  - Investigates the structure and content of the dataset, identifying features and target variables.

## 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning:** 
  - Handles missing values, if any, and performs necessary data cleaning procedures.
  
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Possibly creates new features or modifies existing ones to improve model performance.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Conducts exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable.

- **Visualization:**
  - Uses visualizations (potentially with Seaborn or Matplotlib) to depict distributions, correlations, and trends in the data.

## 4. Model Building and Evaluation

- **Model Selection:**
  - Implements various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classifier, CatBoost Classifier, or others suitable for classification tasks.

- **Model Training and Tuning:**
  - Trains the models on the dataset and fine-tunes hyperparameters to optimize performance.

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Assesses the models using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. A confusion matrix might be utilized to visualize the model's performance.
